	abstract = {Extraction of features and subsequent classification of ground moving targets, especially humans and vehicles, are topics of great relevance for the theoretical research and practical application in the signal processing of the ground surveillance radar. Through the time–frequency analysis of ground moving target, the energy distribution of spectrogram can be regarded as a kind of image texture. On the basis of this, a novel method for the feature extraction of micro-motion targets is proposed in this study. In the proposed method, the spectrograms of targets’ echoes are first obtained through the short-time Fourier transform. To improve the precision of features extracted, a pre-processing based on the spectrogram is followed to enhance image features. On the basis of targets’ spectrograms, the entropy, third-order moment of statistical histogram and directionality features are extracted finally as jointly effective features of micro-motion targets. The support vector machine (SVM) is utilised to classify the ground moving targets and a high probability of correct classification is obtained. The experimental results under different signal-to-noise ratio and training sample number conditions verify the validity and robustness of the proposed method.},
